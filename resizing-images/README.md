# Using

Make sure `sudo chmod 777 resize.sh` (Only need once for the first time)

Whenever you create a new post:

1. Put the featured image in the same folder with `resize.sh`
2. Run `./resize.sh`
3. Done

It will create a new folder called `resized` contains all resized-named images (i.e, `*_lg.jpg`, `*_md.jpg`, `*_placehold.jpg`,...) for your post.
