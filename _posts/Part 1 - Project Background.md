## Topic research

In the early 1900s, telemarketing prevailed as an effective sales strategy (Johnson & Meiners, 1987). In fact, it created more job opportunities with an evident spike in sales from employing it (Johnson & Meiners, 1987). On the flipside, marketers have expressed grave concerns regarding customer satisfaction and loyalty for certain organisations as these are arduous to achieve and easily tainted by telemarketing programmes that involve comission-driven sales personnel (Mark, James & Michael, 1994). Despite the company's product being relevant to the customer, inappropriate calling etiquette may lead to the customer hanging up or even patronizing competitors (Mark, James & Michael, 1994). These days, people are also skeptical about telemarketing due to the potential for fraudulent behaviour. Providing personal account details over the phone is definitely out of the question.

With reference to Figure 1 by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), there appears to be a significant increase in __Spam Statistics__, in the month of January and February 2017. The __Do Not Call Complains__ in Figure 2, also increased significantly in the month of May and June 2017.

## Business scenario

Based on personal observations (plausibly biased), one may argue that telemarketing is a dying strategy that is not only ill-targeted, but frustrating for customers who do not require these financial products and are constantly interrupted in their daily routine from these untimely calls.

This could also be substantiated with evidence that direct marketing via digital platforms from understanding consumer insights/behaviour data, these days, prove to be more successful compared to a blanket call to all customers.

However, simply eradicating telemarketing as a campaign may deprive revenue stream for financial institutions from a legacy segment of customers who may still value this as a strategy.

## About the dataset

This dataset contains customer profiles of a Portugese bank institution and whether they end up subscribing to a term deposit following a direct marketing campaign via phone calls.

<br> Source of dataset: __[Kaggle: Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)__

## Objective

1. Identify any statistically significant relationship between variables in the dataset and provide practical business insights or trends if available.
2. Formulate and fine-tune models that will most reliably predict customers whom will more likely subscribe to a fixed deposit from a telemarketing campaign.
3. Reduce the probability of predicting that a customer will not put down a fixed deposit, when in actual fact he/she will.

## Value-added proposition

1. Improves workplace efficiency, campaign success rate and customer satisfaction through direct marketing to a more targeted and receptive audience.
2. Prediction can estimate the volume of calls to be made which can better inform human resource allocation for project management.
3. Legacy segment of customers who truly appreciate telemarketing campaigns are not left out.
4. Retains the revenue stream from relevant telemarketing.
